### Style isn’t built in isolation

What we wear is shaped by what we see,  
and what we hear while moving through the world.

A fit can come from a scene in a film,  
a lyric that sticks,  
or the grain of an old photo found online.

Clothing doesn’t live alone —  
it’s part of a bigger frequency.

### Fits we’re into

Oversized layers that move with you.  
Muted palettes broken with a single bold accent.  
Textures that feel lived-in, not showroom-perfect.

We’re chasing silhouettes that echo confidence quietly,  
instead of shouting for attention.

> The right fit is like a soundtrack:  
> you feel it before you understand it.

### Films on the board

Cinema is our second sketchbook.

- **Neo-noir shadows** inspire dark cuts and sharp contrasts.
- **’90s indie frames** remind us that imperfection is honest.
- **Japanese minimalism** teaches us restraint — space between details.

Every still is a moodboard waiting to be translated into cloth.

### Frequencies on repeat

What we listen to decides the rhythm of our process.

A heavy bassline makes stitching feel urgent.  
Lo-fi beats slow down our layering decisions.  
Voices sampled from old tracks spark unexpected visuals.

Sound creates motion —  
and motion decides silhouette.

### Fits, Films & Frequencies

The drop you wear tomorrow  
was already hidden in the track we played last week,  
in the film frame we paused mid-scene,  
in the notes scribbled while rewinding.

Because style isn’t just clothes.  
It’s a frequency you tune into —  
and if you’re listening close enough,  
you’ll catch it before it fades.
