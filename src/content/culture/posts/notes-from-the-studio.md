### Drops don’t start with fabric

They start with **fragments**.  
A torn magazine page.  
A subway poster glimpsed at midnight.  
The way light hits concrete after rain.

Every piece in this drop comes from those scattered notes —  
the things we collected, cut, pinned, and layered until they began to speak
back.

> A moodboard is not decoration.  
> It’s a map.  
> And every stitch we make is us following its coordinates.

### Behind the moodboard

This collection wasn’t born in silence — it was born in **collage**.

We pinned typography torn from flyers.  
Muted tones from old cinema frames.  
Textures from thrift finds and street corners.

The moodboard became a diary — not just of inspiration,  
but of **intent**.  
It told us what to keep raw,  
and what to refine.

### From paper to pattern

Translating mood into clothing means asking:  
how does an image feel **when worn**?

- A photo of peeling paint becomes a distressed knit.
- A sharp shadow inspires a clean seam.
- A sketch turns into an embroidered detail you only notice up close.

We treat every reference like a conversation.  
The fabric answers back.

### Style as translation

What you see on the rack isn’t just clothing —  
it’s a chain of interpretations.

From eye → to paper → to fabric → to fit.

Each step loses something, but gains something else.  
And in that loss, in that distortion,  
**the identity of the drop is born.**

### Why we keep notes

Because memory fades.  
Because moments slip.  
Because without records, a collection risks becoming empty aesthetic.

Notes — scribbled, torn, photographed —  
are how we resist that emptiness.

> Behind every hoodie,  
> there’s a scrap of paper saying:  
> _“Don’t forget this feeling.”_

### Notes from the studio

Every drop is a translation of fleeting thoughts into lasting form.  
And in the end,  
**the moodboard is less about what we made —  
and more about what moved us.**
