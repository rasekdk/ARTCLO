### Concrete isn’t cold

It’s heavy.  
It’s raw.  
It’s honest.

When we looked at brutalist architecture for this drop,  
we didn’t see lifeless walls.  
We saw **structure stripped down to truth** —  
design that refuses to hide behind polish.

That became our mood.

### Brutal lines, soft textures

Sharp corners translated into bold seams.  
Monolithic blocks inspired oversized cuts.  
But we paired those with fabrics that move,  
that breathe,  
that let the body soften the silhouette.

The contrast matters.  
Concrete doesn’t bend.  
But cloth does.  
And the tension between the two creates presence.

### Influence beyond the skyline

Brutalism isn’t just about buildings —  
it’s about philosophy.

- **Function over flair.**
- **Mass over ornament.**
- **Truth over trend.**

Those ideas guided every decision.  
From how we placed zippers,  
to how we left some edges raw,  
to why we resisted over-branding.

> Architecture taught us restraint.  
> To let form hold weight without decoration.

### Wearing architecture

When you put on these pieces,  
you’re wearing echoes of towers and plazas.  
Not literally —  
but in the way the silhouette holds space.

The jacket that feels like a block of shadow.  
The hoodie that falls like a slab cut clean.  
The tee that frames you like a façade.

### Brutal Influence

This drop isn’t about buildings.  
It’s about how **space and structure**  
shift the way we move,  
the way we carry ourselves,  
the way clothing becomes a kind of architecture.

And just like the concrete it draws from,  
we designed it to last —  
long after trends crumble.
