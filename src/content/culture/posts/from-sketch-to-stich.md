### Every silhouette starts invisible

Before the fabric, before the cut —  
there’s a sketch.

Not always clean lines on a page.  
Sometimes it’s a rough scribble on a receipt.  
Sometimes it’s just a gesture in the air.

But in that moment, the shape already exists.  
**Clothes are born first as motion, not material.**

### From line to layer

The sketch is only a suggestion.  
What matters is how it transforms once it touches cloth.

- A straight pencil line turns fluid on drape.
- A sharp angle softens when worn.
- A curve bends differently with every step you take.

That’s why our process isn’t just drawing —  
it’s testing, folding, pinning, unpinning.  
The page never survives untouched.

### Stitch as decision

Every stitch is a choice.  
To hold a seam.  
To break a line.  
To let the body speak louder than the thread.

We don’t chase complexity for its own sake.  
A single seam, placed with intent,  
can say more than layers of decoration.

> **Restraint is part of design.**  
> Knowing when not to stitch is as important as stitching itself.

### Silhouette as language

The final piece doesn’t carry the sketch with it —  
but it carries its spirit.

Oversized lines signal comfort, grounding.  
Tailored cuts signal focus, presence.  
Layered shapes let you inhabit contradictions.

Silhouettes are sentences.  
You read them in motion.  
You write them when you wear them.

### From sketch to stitch

The journey isn’t about perfection.  
It’s about translation —  
turning the rough into the refined,  
without erasing its edge.

Because when we design,  
we don’t want clothes that just look finished.  
We want clothes that still **remember the sketch.**
